# DSA-Journal

A repository for daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms problems. This repo contains solutions, notes, and explanations aimed at improving problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

## How This Repo Works

- I add multiple DSA problems and their solutions daily.
- Problems cover various topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- Solutions include code (usually in [your language]) and explanation.
- Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## Goals

- Build strong algorithmic thinking through consistent practice.
- Track progress over time.
- Prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders/topics to find problems.
- Study the solutions and understand the approach.
- Try solving the problems yourself before looking at the code.
- Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
